## `JavaScript Engineer React Task`

Multi input

The task is to implement a multi input component using React.

### `Requirements`

Edit items: simply using the inputs<br>

Delete items: clicking on the X<br>

Add new item: simply after starting to type into the last input<br>

The component should have an onChange event handler which should be called with an array of the actual items excluding the last empty one when the user clicks save. For example: [‘first’, ‘second’, ‘third’]<br>

The component should be able to be updated at any time via its props.<br>

Use PropTypes<br>

Deploy the solution and send us the link to your working multi input<br>

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
The solution is hosted on Heroku, and you can access it anywhere from:
